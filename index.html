    <h1>Bits of Entropy</h1>
    <p>Shannon entropy was introduced by Claude E. Shannon in the 1948 paper "A Mathematical Theory of Communication". It's this equation:</p>

    <p>In short, it's the "average minimum number of bits needed to encode a string of symbols, based on the frequency of the symbols"(<a href="http://www.bearcave.com/misl/misl_tech/wavelets/compression/shannon.html" alt="Bear Cave article on Shannon entropy">source</a>.</p>
    <p>In this calculator, we have a set of emoji, and we can edit the probability of their occurence in the set. You can also add more emoji and see how the number of items in the set affects the entropy!</p>
