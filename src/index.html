    <h1>Bits of Entropy</h1>
    <p>Shannon entropy was introduced by Claude E. Shannon in the 1948 paper "A Mathematical Theory of Communication". It's this equation:</p>

    <p>In short, it's a way of calculating the "information entropy" of a set, based on the probability distribution among values in the set.</p>
    <p>In this calculator, we have a set of emoji, and we can edit the probability of their occurence in the set. You can also add more emoji and see how the number of items in the set affects the entropy!</p>
